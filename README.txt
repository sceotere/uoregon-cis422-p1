Description: 
This cold call application is designed to be ran by a professor during a lecture. It features 4 "on deck" students who have their names displayed on the screen so they know they can be cold called. The arrow keys allow the professor to remove a student who has been cold called from the "on deck" display, which will save data on how many times that student has been cold called to an output file.

Reason for Project:
This project was created for CIS 422, Winter term 2020, Anthony Hornof, Group Project #1, at the University of Oregon.

How to install:
1. Download the zip “G3ColdCall.zip”
2. Unzip the file “G3ColdCall.zip”
3. Double click ColdCall to open. NOTE: ColdCall and Cold_call_files must be in the same directory.

5. Open Terminal and cd to the directory that ColdCall is in.
6. Type “chmod 777 ColdCall”
7. Open ColdCall again by double clicking
8. Click the “Import” button in the Cold Call window.
9. Find the class roster and open it. A test roster has been provided in the "test" folder. See below for the correct file formatting if you wish to create your own.
10. You are ready to use Cold Call for class!

Correct File Formatting for Importing Roster:
The student roster needs to be a “.txt” file that is TAB-delimited, ideally generated by Excel. 
The first line of the file needs to contain the following (also TAB-delimited) header: “FirstName LastName ID-Number Email ColdCallCount Flag FlagCount”. 
The rows that follow should contain student information in the format according to the header above. The "ColdCallCount" "Flag" and "FlagCount" fields must all be initialized to 0 to start.

Software Dependencies:
Python 3

Directory Structure:
"Cold_Call_Files" contains all the source code for the cold call application.
"Docs" contains the SRS, SDS, and other technical documentation.
"Test" contains a sample roster that can be imported into the cold call application.

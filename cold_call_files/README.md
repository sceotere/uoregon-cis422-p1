Shared repository for group: <group-name>s CIS 422 Winter 2020 Project 1 at the University of Oregon

The goal of the project is for our group to successfully manage and develop a "Classroom Cold-Call Assist Software Program" largely based on the SRS written and provided by Professor Anthony Hornof.

## Weekly meeting schedule

Group members will plan to have regular meetings at the following times:
  - Mondays \@ 11:30 am
  - Thursdays \@ 4:00 pm
  - *more times may be added as needed*

A member in attendance will write and upload summaries of each meeting to the `records/meetings` folder.

## Communication

Group members will communicate outside of in-person meetings using the following:
  - Group text messaging
  - Slack workspace

## Tasks and assignments

Tasks and assignments will be recorded in a shared spreadsheet and periodically archived in the `records/tasks` folder.

Generally, before modifying the shared and up-to-date file, the spreadsheet should be archived first by saving a copy with the current date in the filename as such: `TaskAssignments_mmddyy.xlsx`. (This can be done by saving a copy to your local repository and then using `git add TaskAssignments_\*.xlsx`.)

## Description: 
This cold call application is designed to be ran by a professor during a lecture. It features 4 "on deck" students who have their names displayed on the screen so they know they can be cold called. The arrow keys allow the professor to remove a student who has been cold called from the "on deck" display, which will save data on how many times that student has been cold called to an output file.

Shared repository for group: <group-name>'s CIS 422 Winter 2020 Project 1 at the University of Oregon

The goal of the project is for our group to successfully develop a "Classroom Cold-Call Assist Software Program" as outlined in the pre-provided SRS.

## Weekly meeting schedule

*TBD*

## Communication

Group members will communicate outside of in-person meetings using the following:
  - Text messaging
  - *TBD*.

## Tasks and assignments

Tasks and assignments will be recorded in 'TaskAssignments_CURRENT.xlsx', an Excel spreadsheet found in the 'management' folder.

Generally, before modifying the file, the spreadsheet should be archived first by making a copy with the current date in the filename as such: 'TaskAssignments_mmddyy.xlsx'. This can be done by saving a copy in Excel and then using 'git add TaskAssignments_\*.xlsx'.

10. You are ready to use Cold Call for class!


Correct File Formatting for Importing Roster:

The student roster needs to be a “.txt” file that is TAB-delimited, ideally generated by Excel. 
The first line of the file needs to contain the following (also TAB-delimited) header: “FirstName LastName ID-Number Email ColdCallCount Flag FlagCount”. 
The rows that follow should contain student information in the format according to the header above. The "ColdCallCount" "Flag" and "FlagCount" fields must all be initialized to 0 to start.
